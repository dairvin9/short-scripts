# PURPOSE
I wanted to play with hashing and see what dictionary attacks are like. TIL: you can go from know nothing about hashing to cracking passwords with dictionary attacks in a couple hours if you know python. The internet is a scary place. 

# Info
I got the list of bad passwords from https://wiki.skullsecurity.org/Passwords
